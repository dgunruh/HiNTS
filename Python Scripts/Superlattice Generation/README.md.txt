# Python NP superlattice generation
## This is the original code, and more complete than the Julia version. It includes support for the following:
- Grain boundaries (of multiple possible Miller indice combinations)
- Twin planes
- Cracks/tears
- Vacancies

## It also has several quality of life features. However, it is notably slower than the Julia code.
## The necking code is inferior to the Julia necking code, and the Julia code should be used instead.
