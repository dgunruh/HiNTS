1. (CHECK) Introduce enhanced effective medium approximation to account for necked structures
	- Bruggeman/ Shklovskii approximation, and do it NP by NP
	- effective medium approximation for the entire sample, independent of local sample
	- Look at small regions surrounding each NP. More difficult but potentially more accurate.
		Would allow for differences between fully necked NPs and fully isolated ones. 
2. Develop better approximation for the orbital hybridization term.
	- Basic approximation is that E_hybrid = h*Gamma (where Gamma is the tunneling rate)
	- More advanced determination should involve the wavefunction overlap integral I
3. Once metallic transport is enabled, electron transport can happen via clusters of metallically fused NPs. 
	- Caveat is that we already determined transport rate via necks. 
	- Look into bandlike transport: determine k, and then transport occurs via applied electric field ala ensemble monte carlo
	- Could have small clusters of mini-bands, broken up by extended states

4. Better NP samples need to be created
	- Targets of interest: impact of necking width distribution, impact of neck number distribution
	- Impacts of NP size distribution and filling on these numbers as well
	- Do a 4 layer system
	- Neck across the sample edges
	- Have a mixture of NPs that are necked but don't "overlap," and overlapped NPs where the overlap
		radius determines the neck width
	- Add term which pulls NPs together if they are necked (weakly though)

5. Look at coherence of electron transport. Hopping destroys coherence, tunneling through necks maintains it (if fermi golden rule)
	- Examine phase twisting: start with electrons of different phases on either side, do the phases mix
	- Phase evolves as e^(ikx) where k = sqrt(2m*E)/hbar
	- Decoherent transport: electrons lose phase information
