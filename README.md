HiNTS: Hierarchical Nanoparticle Transport Simulator

This Java code comprises the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm which powers the transport simulations. All nanoparticle superlattices are created in Python (historic structures were created using PackLSD). For details of the method, see: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03141
