HiNTS: Hierarchical Nanoparticle Transport Simulator

This Java code comprises the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm which powers the transport simulations. All nanoparticle superlattices were created using either Python or Julia. Historic structures were created using PackLSD. For details of the method, see: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03141
